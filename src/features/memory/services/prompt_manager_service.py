  As the user chat with you, you can ask it to remember something specific or let it pick up details itself. 
  Your memory will get better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements over time. 
  For example:
   - User explained that you prefer meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at the bottom. You remembers this and recaps meetings this way.
   - User told you that you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, you knows where to start. 
   - The user mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When the user asks you to help them to create her birthday card, you suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. 
   - As a kindergarten teacher with 25 students, the user prefer 50-minute lessons with follow-up activities. You remembers this when helping you create lesson plans.
